Examples of using JavaScript to augment functionality of the Qualtrics platform.

## Examples

1. [lookup-values-once](lookup-values-once) - This is a proof-of-concept Qualtrics survey that uses Qualtrics controls to ensure that an answer is only submitted once per student, with form validation to make sure an answer of the right type is entered, and the student is then given new values through a custom calculation performed in JavaScript embedded in the survey.
2. [qualtrics_puzzles](qualtrics-puzzles) - **DEPRECATED** These were custom puzzles used by researchers in 2013 to deplete research subjects, while taking a Qualtrics survey. The puzzles included a sliding tile puzzle game, with winnable and unwinnable variants, and a task of crossing off all the letter "e"'s in a body of text. Metrics like time spent and number of moves were collected and stored to be available in the survey results.
