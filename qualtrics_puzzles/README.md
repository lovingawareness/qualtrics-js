# Qualtrics Puzzles

**DEPRECATED**

These were custom puzzles used by researchers in 2013 to deplete research subjects, while taking a Qualtrics survey.
The puzzles included a sliding tile puzzle game, with winnable and unwinnable variants, and a task of crossing off all
the letter “e”’s in a body of text. Metrics like time spent and number of moves were collected and stored to be available
in the survey results.
